DSL Weirdness 
------------

  get("/nouns/:term")  { implicit ctx =>
    println(params)
  }


the "implicit ctx =>" syntax is a little weird also we are not giving the user access to thread locals to allow them to access request/session/params/etc easily outside of the current method. 

there is a trade off. thread locals means that it is harder to integrate other peoples libraries that use @suspendable because there is no way to ensure they clean up our thread locals when they 'shift' and restore our thread locals when they callback into us. 

but no thread locals can be pain. not sure what to do at the moment.
